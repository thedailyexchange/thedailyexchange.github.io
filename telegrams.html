My degree project, The Daily Exchange, is the namesake of an 1800s Baltimore newspaper, and a semester-long process of mimicking that shift. </br></br>The Daily Exchange was chosen as the source of content due to its relatively impartial reporting and thus reflection of life in Baltimore during the mid-1800s. It ran from 1858 to 1861, and it began as a publication that was highly critical of The Know-Nothing Party who strongly opposed the presence of immigrants, particularly in political offices and competition for jobs.</h2>

After inquiring the name of the vessel, where from and whither bound, her papers were demanded and shown. The British official then proceeded to examine the papers at his leisure and the Anglo-Saxon was detained one hour and a half, awaiting the action of the British functionary. The papers were then handed to the captain of the Anglo-Saxon and she proceeded on her voyage. The collector of this Port will procure the necessary affidavits in connection with this outrage, and forward them to the proper department at Washington without delay.</h3></li>

			<h3>Dec. 30 &mdash; <i>The Herald</i>&#8217;s special corespondent at Panama learns, through a private source of high character, in the northern part of Nicaragua, that a scheme to carry out a revolution in that Republic, and place the Democrats of Leon in favor again, is on foot. A plan is laid in conjunction with Gen. Walker&#8217;s movements in the United States and the Government of Honduras. The filibusters at Mobile are expected to land at Truxillo or Omoa and cross from Honduras to Leon. President Santas Guardeota has promised to assist them with five hundred natives in driving Martinez from Nicaragua. He made it a condition, however, that Gen. Walker should not accompany the expedition. From Omoa or Truxillo the meditated march is practicable, as the distance is not very great.</h3></li>

The receipts into the State Treasury for the past two years have been $1,361,000, and the expenditures for the same period, $1,132,000. The Governor hopes that additional aid will be granted for the completion of the Pacific Railroad to Kansas City. He advises that instead of selling the roads to make them pay the interest on the State bonds, that measures be taken to secure the faithful application of the receipts of the companies to legitimate purposes, allowing the roads to be worked until their ability to pay is fairly tested. The number of public shares in the State have been increased in the last three years from 1,500 to 3,380. The Governor urges the establishment of an agricultural college. He says he has received communications from the Legislatures of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, on the subject of slavery, of a very illiberal character. He has not acknowledged their receipt, and will not submit them to the Legislature unless they are specially called for.</h3></li>
