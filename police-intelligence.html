My degree project, The Daily Exchange, is the namesake of an 1800s Baltimore newspaper, and a semester-long process of mimicking that shift. </br></br>The Daily Exchange was chosen as the source of content due to its relatively impartial reporting and thus reflection of life in Baltimore during the mid-1800s. It ran from 1858 to 1861, and it began as a publication that was highly critical of The Know-Nothing Party who strongly opposed the presence of immigrants, particularly in political offices and competition for jobs.</h2>

			<h4><b>Horrible Accident</h4></b>
			<h3>A most horrible accident occurred on Monday evening last, at the residence of Dr. Dennis J. McKew, No. 154 Street &mdash; A little daughter of that gentleman, about six years of age, named Victoria Elizabeth McKew, took one of the camphene lamps during the absence of the family from the room, and entering the back room, mounted herself upon a chair and attempted to light the gas, and in so doing knocked off the top of the lamp. The fluid poured out over her entire person, and was instantly ignited, setting fire to her clothing, and burning her in a terrible manner before her screams were heard by the members of the family. Her mother hearing her cries for help ran to her assistance and finally succeeded in extinguishing the flames. She was attended by her distressed father and Dr. Miltenberger, who did everything in their power to alleviate her sufferings, but without avail, as she died on Wednesday morning in convulsions, after lingering in intense agony for thirty-six hours. Mrs. McKew in endeavoring to extinguish the flames was badly burned about the hands and arms.</h3>

			<h3>An interesting little son of Mr. John Peach met with an accident yesterday, which terminated fatally. He attempted to jump on one of the cars while they were in motion in the yard of the Bolton Depot, on the Northern Central Railroad, when he missed his footing and fell to the ground, and before he could escape was run over by one of the trucks, fracturing his skull in a horrible manner. The services of Drs. Greentree and Maris were obtained, but nothing could be done to alleviate his sufferings and he expired in about two hours afterwards.</h3>

		<li><h2><b>John Carney and Nicholas Pfifer, assault with intent to kill</b></h2><h3>John Carney and Nicholas Pfifer were arraigned before the Mayor yesterday morning on the charge of as assaulting with intent to kill John Mason.<p>John Mason, the party assailed, testified that he resides on the Falls Road near Mount Vernon factory, and was on his way home on Wednesday evening, and when near the city limits, he was met by three young men, who, with out any provocation whatever struck him with their fists and knocked him down, and then kicked and stamped him in the head and face. He succeeded in regaining his feet, and ran some distance down the road into his sister&#8217;s house, and succeeded in closing the door before the party who were pursuing him could reach the house; when they did arrive they demanded admittance, and upon being refused kicked the door with such force that two of the panels were broken in. After making serious threats they left, apparently satisfied with having defaced the premises. Witness thinks they were all drunk. He could recognise two of them, Cardney and Pfifer, but could not tell who the other man was.<p>Temperance Smith, a sister of Mason&#8217;s, testified to the party having broken the door, but did not see the assault; did not see them have any weapons.	Officers Handy and Brooks were examined and testified that they found the party on the Falls road near the city limits, and upon their attempting to arrest them they were unable to detain but two or them, the other making good his escape. The Mayor imposed the usual fine of 66 cts. and costs for drunkeness, and committed them both to jail in default of $500 bail to answer at Court. It is alleged by persons residing in the neighborhood, that the same party made an attack upon a young man named Chafman and another man whose name is unknown, and beat them very severely.

The servant left the beggar in the hall while she went to inform her mistress of his request, and during her absence he stole a marble clock from off the mantle-piece and left.</h3>
