My degree project, The Daily Exchange, is the namesake of an 1800s Baltimore newspaper, and a semester-long process of mimicking that shift. </br></br>The Daily Exchange was chosen as the source of content due to its relatively impartial reporting and thus reflection of life in Baltimore during the mid-1800s. It ran from 1858 to 1861, and it began as a publication that was highly critical of The Know-Nothing Party who strongly opposed the presence of immigrants, particularly in political offices and competition for jobs.</h2>

  		<span style="float:left;color:#FF4500;font-size:60px;line-height:30px;padding-top:40px; padding-right:10px;font-family: 'Lora', serif; z-index: 90;">T</span><h3>here are two ways of destroying a man&#8217;s reputation &mdash; one by misrepresenting his conversation, the other by slandering his life. Novels, in which religious controversies are conducted in the form of dialogues between champions of opposite doctrines, resemble 		the former, while those in which a creed is assailed by a well wrought story, imputing all manner of wicked deeds to its followers, belongs to the latter class of evil speaking. The controversial form, of which there are many examples is generly so silly as to be harmless. The shallow trick of setting up just such of your adversaries arguments as you can without difficulty knock over, is easily seen through. It is the old story of the artist, trying to convince the lion of man&#8217;s superiority by showing a picture of a lion, subdued by 	a man. The other form is more insidious. A well told tale although pure fiction, for the time at least, has and is intended to have all the effect of a statement of facts. If the story be capable of exciting any interest it is only because its incidents have so nearly the form of truth as temporarily to deceive the judgment. This, though perfectly allowable	when it is merely intended to excite the imagination, to amuse, interest, or even convey some sound moral in the form of fiction, becomes, when it is made the vehicle of an 		assault upon a faith by representing its priests as guilty of indictable offences, and its 	people as invariably ignorant and ruffianly, to speak plainly, very much like malicious lying. <i>The New Priest in Conception Bay</i> is a work of this class. It is a story of Newfound		land, the object of which seems to be to exalt the Church of England by vilifying the Church of Rome. Church of England by vilifying the Church of Rome. 
  		<p>The plot is briefly as follows: A married man with a lovely wife and several children becomes a priest in the Catholic Church, and of course parts with his family. All this occurs prior to the beginning of the tale which opens at Peterport, a small fishing village on the coast of Newfoundland, where the wife appears in the character of a beautiful, mourning widow, with one child, the others having died, and the husband in the person of the &#8220;new Priest.&#8221; There were two other priests, Fathers Terrence and Nicholas, the one a good matured and simple Irishman, the other the villain of the story. There is moreover a good old fisherman with a lovely daughter, who is so unhappy as to get into bad odor with the Catholics, because a young man designed for the priesthood falls in love with her, declining holy orders in consequence. The fisherman&#8217;s daughter, becomes greviously sick, and when, after lingering long at the very gates of death, she begins to come round, in a moment of delirium, during the absence of her nurse, escapes from the house and is not seen again at Peterport for a long time. It afterwards appears that she, naturally enough took the direction of the home of her lover &mdash; whose family were Catholics &mdash; and there by a combination between an old Irish hag and father Nicholas and some nuns &mdash; she was carried off &mdash; in a punt to a nunnery. From this place she makes her 	escape after a few days, and mysteriously gets aboard of the &#8220;Spring Bird,&#8221; a brig which has just left Peterport for Madeira and a market. Appearing here in the midst of a fog, she is taken for a ghost, and has a handspike thrown at her head by a sailor &mdash; but is
		soon, however, recognized and made much of.
		<p>Notwithstanding the absurdity of the story &mdash; and the unwarrantable mode of attacking a religion to which the author is opposed, the book is worth reading for its 	apparently faithful delineations of the scenes and manners of a very strange corner of the globe. It shows such powers of description, such command of good English &mdash; and such a happy faculty of presenting the peculiarities of dialect of his characters, including a very good specimen of Yankee &mdash; that we are inclined to suspect it to be the production of the distinguished author of &#8220;The Life and Adventures of a Clock Pedlar.&#8221;

We have heretofore expressed a high opinion of the merits of this useful publication, and a careful examination of the contents of the volume before us has only added to our conviction of its value. On all subjects of special interest to American readers it is unquestionable. So great a mass of information, as is here presented, could only have been given by close condensation and a careful pruning of all extraneous matter. It is in this respect that the talent of the editors is particularly manifest. Every thing that is essential in a popular manual will be found under its appropriate head. Facts alone are given &mdash; the reader being left wholly free to draw his own conclusions. So far, the work has been carried out in a careful regard to the wants of the American public. To the articles usually introduced into works of this class a vast amount of original matter has been added, not only in the arts and sciences, but also in general literature, and particularly will this be found the case in those departments of knowledge which are frequently touched upon too lightly	in foreign books of reference. <i>The New American Cyclopedia</i> is, moreover, eminently practical. There is nothing speculative about it. The great merit of the work is that it compresses, into the smallest possible compass, a large amount of information upon almost every imaginable subject, while the style in which the articles are written is peculiarly clear and chaste.

Duganne, a gentleman not unknown in the literary world, and with whose occasional lyrics, more terse than poetic, some of our readers are probably	familiar. As Chairman of a Committee appointed by the Legislature of New York to investigate and report upon the evils of the tenant house system, Mr. Duganne, in the	prosecution of the duty assigned to him, was enabled not only to lay before the Legislature a mass of valuable statistics upon the subject, but also to gather, in the course of his perambulations, many of the facts and incidents which he has worked up into the present volume. Like the &#8220;Hot Corn&#8221; stories of Solon Robinson, &#8220;The Tenant	House&#8221; treats of low life in New York, and may be correctly defined, as a body of facts
		dressed in the garb of a Romance. The aim of the writer has been to show how the poor outcasts of society live; the temptations to which they are exposed; the vices into
		which they are betrayed, and the diseases to which their debased condition subjects them. The book itself, though of the &#8220;sensation&#8221; class, conveys an impressive moral &mdash; 
		many of its incidents being of a deeply tragic cast. It is vigorously written, and as it has been warmly commended by quite a number of New York Clergymen, it is doubtless
		destined to acquire considerable popularity.
